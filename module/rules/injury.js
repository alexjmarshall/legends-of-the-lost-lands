// TODO
// go through every feature and write a comment with effect
// define active effect for every inherent feature that needs one, and add the effect changes in every class/race that uses it
// and update level up code to always delete/add inherent/limited use features
// test a char level up with inherent/limited use features e.g. berserker and swashbuckler
// reduce range of weapon impacts to Combat & Tactics scale? maybe d20 for maul
// ^ maybe targets of 2/4/6/8/10 and d3/d4/d6/d8/d10/d12 dice
// -- update weapon spreadsheet

// TODO write lil monte carlo script to estimate heal/spell learn odds
// remember when deleting injuries/disease items, have to delete TimeQ events too -- make button that does both
// when cuts heal, rename as scar

// use d20 monster stealth vs. passive listen score for surprise, use best passive listen in the party
// roll morale on d20 for monsters/retainers
// use 2d6 for reaction

// THEN CONTINUE to actor derived data!!!
// use a derived object for all derived data
