// TODO
// update char code to use negative AC and roll over skill values and all feature descriptions. -- Nahhhh....
//     -- use negative AC and Saving throw bonuses. Always refer to bonus or penalty to be clear whether the negative is good.
// reduce range of weapon impacts to Combat & Tactics scale? maybe d20 for maul
// ^ maybe targets of 2/4/6/8/10 and d3/d4/d6/d8/d10/d12 dice
// -- update weapon spreadsheet

// THEN CONTINUE to actor derived data!!!
// use a derived object for all derived data
// -- include all derived attributes mentioned in features as base data

// write lil monte carlo script to estimate heal/spell learn odds
// -- good for learn spell!
// -- for heal, use 11 or 14 for untreated TN, and add 3-9 for treatment
// remember when deleting injuries/disease items, have to delete TimeQ events too -- make button that does both
// when cuts heal, rename as scar

// use d20 monster stealth vs. passive listen score for surprise, use best passive listen in the party
// roll morale on d20 for monsters/retainers
// use 2d6 for reaction
