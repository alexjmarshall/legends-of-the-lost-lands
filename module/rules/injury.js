// THEN CONTINUE to actor derived data!!!
// use a derived object for all derived data
// -- include all derived attributes mentioned in features as base data

// estimate heal/spell learn odds for num successes before 3 failures
// -- good for learn spell!
// -- for heal, goal is to get to 6 TN for fully treated injury.
// -- Start with 9, 12 or 15 TN, and subtract 3, 6, or 9 for treatments.
// remember when deleting injuries/disease items, have to delete TimeQ events too -- make button that does both
//  -- or simply set up the event so if it can't find the item it deletes itself
// when cuts heal, rename as scar if permanent

// use d20 monster stealth vs. passive listen score for surprise, use best passive listen in the party
// roll morale on d20 for monsters/retainers
// use 2d6 for reaction
